 Test the Application:

 + Run without any argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/cli-app
  A subcommand is required
  Run with --help for more information.
#+END_SRC

 + Show help.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ bin/cli-app -h
  cli-app
  Usage: bin/cli-app [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

  Options:
    -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
